# webhooks.cc

> Webhook testing tools for developers. Capture, inspect, forward, and test webhooks with a dashboard, CLI, TypeScript SDK, and MCP server for AI agents.

## What is webhooks.cc?

webhooks.cc is a webhook inspection and testing service. Developers use it to capture incoming HTTP requests at unique URLs, inspect headers and bodies in real time, configure mock responses, forward webhooks to localhost for local development, and write automated test assertions against captured requests.

The Rust receiver handles 86,000+ requests per second with sub-millisecond capture latency. All state is buffered in Redis and flushed to Convex for real-time dashboard updates.

## Core capabilities

- Webhook capture: Send any HTTP request to https://go.webhooks.cc/w/<slug> and inspect it instantly
- Mock responses: Configure status codes, headers, and response bodies per endpoint
- CLI tunneling: Forward webhooks to localhost with `whk tunnel <port>` — no port forwarding or ngrok needed
- TypeScript SDK: `@webhooks-cc/sdk` for programmatic endpoint management, test assertions, and real-time streaming
- MCP server: `@webhooks-cc/mcp` connects AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Windsurf)
- Real-time streaming: Dashboard updates via Convex reactive queries, CLI via Server-Sent Events
- Request replay: Resend captured requests to any URL
- Provider detection: Built-in helpers for Stripe, GitHub, Shopify, Slack, Twilio, Paddle, and Linear webhooks

## Pricing

- Free: 200 requests/day, unlimited endpoints, 7-day retention, full CLI/SDK/MCP access
- Pro ($8/month): 500,000 requests/month, 30-day retention

## API key format

All API keys use the prefix `whcc_`. Keys are generated from the account page at https://webhooks.cc/account or via the CLI with `whk auth login`.

## Webhook endpoint URL format

https://go.webhooks.cc/w/<slug>
https://go.webhooks.cc/w/<slug>/optional/path

Any HTTP method, content type, and body up to 100KB is accepted.

## CLI commands

whk                  # Interactive TUI
whk auth login       # Authenticate via browser
whk auth status      # Show login status
whk auth logout      # Clear stored token
whk tunnel <port>    # Forward webhooks to localhost
whk listen <slug>    # Stream requests to terminal
whk create [name]    # Create endpoint
whk list             # List endpoints
whk delete <slug>    # Delete endpoint
whk replay <id>      # Replay captured request
whk update           # Self-update from GitHub releases

## SDK quick start

```typescript
import { WebhooksCC, matchBodyPath } from "@webhooks-cc/sdk";

const client = new WebhooksCC({ apiKey: process.env.WHK_API_KEY });

// Create an endpoint
const endpoint = await client.endpoints.create({ name: "test" });
console.log(endpoint.url); // https://go.webhooks.cc/w/<slug>

// Wait for a webhook to arrive
const request = await client.requests.waitFor(endpoint.slug, {
  timeout: "30s",
  match: matchBodyPath("event", "payment.success"),
});

// Stream requests in real time
for await (const req of client.requests.subscribe(endpoint.slug)) {
  console.log(req.method, req.path);
}

// Clean up
await client.endpoints.delete(endpoint.slug);
```

## MCP server setup

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add webhooks-cc -- npx -y @webhooks-cc/mcp

# Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf
npx @webhooks-cc/mcp setup cursor
npx @webhooks-cc/mcp setup vscode
npx @webhooks-cc/mcp setup windsurf
```

Set the `WHK_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.
