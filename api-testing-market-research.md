## Pricing Patterns Analysis

### Common Pricing Dimensions

1. **Requests/Events per month** - Most common limiter
2. **Data retention period** - 3 days → 30 days → 365 days
3. **Number of endpoints/URLs** - Some charge per endpoint
4. **Team members** - Per-seat vs. unlimited
5. **Features** - Custom domains, SSO, webhooks history, API access

### Price Points in the Market

| Segment | Monthly Price | Annual (typical 15-20% discount) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Free tier | $0 | - |
| Hobbyist/Individual | $8-15 | $80-150 |
| Startup/Small team | $20-50 | $200-500 |

*Fair use policy: ~500K requests/month
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and communicate
- Covers 90% of use cases
- Easy to implement
- Clear upgrade path
- $15 is psychologically in "impulse buy" territory

---

### Option B: Three-Tier Standard
```
FREE        →  $0    (500 req/day, 24hr retention, 3 endpoints)
STARTER     →  $9/mo  (25K/mo, 7-day, 20 endpoints, private)
PRO         →  $25/mo (250K/mo, 30-day, unlimited, team)
```

**Advantages:**
- More pricing flexibility

- Strong competition from webhook.site, requestbin.com
- Content marketing: tutorials for specific integrations (Stripe webhooks, GitHub webhooks, etc.)

### Distribution Channels
1. **Product Hunt** - Critical for initial launch
2. **Dev.to / Hashnode** - Technical blog posts
3. **Twitter/X** - Developer community
4. **Reddit** - r/webdev, r/programming, r/selfhosted
5. **Hacker News** - Show HN

### Positioning Statements

**Option A: Simplicity Focus**
> "The fastest way to debug webhooks. Get a URL in one click."

**Option B: Developer Focus**  
> "API testing built for developers, not accountants. One price, all features."

**Option C: Privacy Focus**
> "Your webhook data stays private. Always."
